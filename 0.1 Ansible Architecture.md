# âœ… 2. Ansible Architecture â€“ Detailed Explanation

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview of Ansible Architecture

Ansible follows a **simple client-server architecture** where the **control node** (the machine Ansible runs on) communicates with **managed nodes** (target servers) over **SSH or WinRM**, without requiring any agent installed on them.

```
+-----------------+       SSH/WinRM        +-------------------+
|  Control Node   |  ------------------>   |   Managed Nodes   |
| (Ansible Host)  |                        | (Linux/Windows)   |
+-----------------+                        +-------------------+
```

## ðŸ”¹ Key Components of Ansible Architecture

---

### 1. **Control Node (Ansible Master)**

* The machine where Ansible is installed and executed
* Initiates **Playbooks**, **ad-hoc commands**, or **roles**
* Connects to managed nodes via SSH/WinRM
* Can manage **multiple environments** (dev, test, prod)

âœ… Requirements:

* Python installed
* SSH access (Linux targets)
* WinRM access (Windows targets)

ðŸ“˜ [Control Node Overview](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/basic_concepts.html#control-node)

---

### 2. **Managed Nodes (Target Hosts)**

* Systems you want to automate (Linux, Windows, Network devices, etc.)
* No Ansible installation or agents needed
* Only require:

  * SSH enabled (Linux/Unix)
  * WinRM configured (Windows)

These systems are listed in the **Inventory file**.

ðŸ“˜ [Managed Nodes Info](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#hosts-and-groups)

---

### 3. **Inventory (Hosts File)**

* A file (INI, YAML, or dynamic) containing the list of target machines
* Defines **groups** of hosts for easier management
* Can be:

  * **Static** â€“ `/etc/ansible/hosts`
  * **Dynamic** â€“ Scripts or plugins for cloud infra (AWS, Azure, etc.)

ðŸ“˜ [Inventory Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

---

### 4. **Modules**

* Units of work that Ansible executes
* Over **1300+ built-in modules** available for:

  * File operations
  * Package management
  * Networking
  * Cloud provisioning
* Modules are **idempotent** â€“ they don't make changes if the system is already in the desired state

ðŸ“˜ [Ansible Built-in Modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index_module.html)

---

### 5. **Plugins**

* Extend Ansibleâ€™s core features
* Types:

  * **Callback Plugins** â€“ Customize output
  * **Connection Plugins** â€“ SSH, WinRM, local, etc.
  * **Inventory Plugins** â€“ Dynamic inventory
  * **Lookup Plugins** â€“ Get variables from external sources

ðŸ“˜ [Plugin Types](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/plugins.html)

---

### 6. **Playbooks**

* YAML files that define automation workflows
* A playbook = List of **plays**
* A play = Set of tasks for a group of hosts
* Each task calls a **module**

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
```

ðŸ“˜ [Playbook Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html)

---

### 7. **Roles**

* Directory structure for organizing playbooks and tasks
* Promotes **reuse and modularity**
* Includes:

  * `tasks/`, `handlers/`, `defaults/`, `vars/`, `templates/`, `files/`, `meta/`

ðŸ“˜ [Roles Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)

---

### 8. **Facts and Variables**

* **Facts**: Collected from managed nodes (e.g., OS, IP address)
* **Variables**: User-defined or auto-collected for dynamic playbook behavior
