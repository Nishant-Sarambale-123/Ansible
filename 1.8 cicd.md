# ✅ 21. CI/CD Integration with Ansible – Full Guide

---

## 🔹 Why Integrate Ansible with CI/CD?

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** automates building, testing, and deploying applications.

🔧 Integrating Ansible enables:

* **Infrastructure provisioning**
* **Environment configuration**
* **App deployment automation**
* **Testing and validation**

## 🔹 Common CI/CD Tools Used with Ansible

| Tool               | Role                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Actions** | Lightweight CI/CD directly in GitHub    |
| **Jenkins**        | Popular open-source automation server   |
| **GitLab CI**      | Git-based CI/CD with integrated runners |
| **CircleCI**       | Cloud-native CI/CD                      |
| **Azure DevOps**   | Full DevOps suite from Microsoft        |

## 🔹 Use Cases of Ansible in CI/CD

| Use Case                                  | Example                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Deploy apps after CI test passes          | Run Ansible to deploy WAR files           |
| Provision environments dynamically        | Use `ansible-playbook` to set up servers  |
| Configuration management across pipelines | Enforce settings across environments      |
| Infrastructure testing (Idempotency)      | Validate infrastructure setup post-commit |

## ✅ Example 1: GitHub Actions + Ansible

### 🔸 Workflow File: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Ansible Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.x

      - name: Install Ansible
        run: pip install ansible

      - name: Run Ansible Playbook
        run: ansible-playbook deploy.yml -i inventory
```

---

## ✅ Example 2: Jenkins + Ansible

### 🔸 Jenkins Pipeline Groovy Script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Clone Repo') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/user/ansible-project.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Install Ansible') {
            steps {
                sh 'sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Playbook') {
            steps {
                sh 'ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## ✅ Example 3: GitLab CI + Ansible

### `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  image: python:3.10
  script:
    - pip install ansible
    - ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory
```

📘 [GitLab CI Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)

## 🔐 Secure Integration (Secrets & SSH)

* Store credentials securely in:

  * GitHub → **Secrets**
  * GitLab → **CI/CD Variables**
  * Jenkins → **Credentials Manager**
* Use SSH private keys or Vault passwords with environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE: vault_pass.txt
```

## ✅ Interview Questions & Scenario-Based Q\&A

---

### ❓ Q1: Why would you use Ansible in a CI/CD pipeline?

**Answer:**
To automate provisioning, app deployment, and configuration after builds/tests in CI.

---

### ❓ Q2: How do you integrate Ansible with GitHub Actions?

**Answer:**
Use `ansible-playbook` in a GitHub workflow (`.yml`) with `pip install ansible` before execution.

---

### ❓ Q3: Scenario – You want to deploy to staging only when a PR is merged to `develop`. How?

**Answer:**
Use GitHub Actions trigger:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
```

---

### ❓ Q4: How do you secure secrets used in Ansible from a CI/CD pipeline?

**Answer:**

* Use CI secrets manager (GitHub Secrets, Jenkins Credentials)
* Use Ansible Vault for encrypted values
* Pass via environment variables

---

### ❓ Q5: Can Ansible verify deployments in CI/CD?

**Answer:**
Yes, use **Ansible playbooks** to test:

* Service status
* Port availability
* Configuration files

---

### ❓ Q6: Scenario – You want to run an Ansible playbook after a Docker image is built. Where in the pipeline should it go?

**Answer:**
Add Ansible deployment as a **post-build step** or in a **separate deploy stage** after `build`.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Use **Ansible roles** to structure code in CI pipelines
* Validate playbooks with `ansible-lint` before running
* Use `--check` mode for dry runs in CI
* Encrypt sensitive data with **Ansible Vault**
* Maintain **separate inventories** for `dev`, `staging`, `prod`
* Pin Ansible version in CI tools for consistency
