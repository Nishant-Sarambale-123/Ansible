# ✅ 14. Error Handling, Tags & Blocks – Full Ansible Guide

---

## 🔴 1. Error Handling in Ansible

---

### 🔹 What is Error Handling?

Ansible provides mechanisms to **control task failures** and **respond to errors gracefully**, ensuring more robust automation.

📘 [Error Handling Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_error_handling.html)

---

### ✅ Key Keywords

| Directive            | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ignore_errors: yes` | Ignore the task failure and continue              |
| `failed_when`        | Mark task as failed based on condition            |
| `changed_when`       | Mark task as changed (even if no change occurred) |
| `rescue:`            | Handle failures                                   |
| `always:`            | Always run regardless of success/failure          |

---

### 🔹 `ignore_errors`

```yaml
- name: This command might fail
  command: /bin/false
  ignore_errors: yes
```

Even though `/bin/false` fails, execution continues.

---

### 🔹 `failed_when`

```yaml
- name: Fail if return code is not 0 or 1
  shell: some_command
  register: result
  failed_when: result.rc not in [0, 1]
```

---

### 🔹 `rescue` and `always` Blocks

```yaml
- name: Use block/rescue/always
  block:
    - name: Try risky command
      command: /bin/false
  rescue:
    - name: Handle the error
      debug:
        msg: "Something went wrong!"
  always:
    - name: Always run
      debug:
        msg: "This always runs."
```

## 🏷️ 2. Tags in Ansible

---

### 🔹 What Are Tags?

Tags allow you to **selectively run parts of a playbook**, skipping others.

📘 [Tags Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html)

---

### 🔹 Using Tags in Tasks

```yaml
- name: Install Apache
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: present
  tags: webserver

- name: Configure firewall
  firewalld:
    service: http
    permanent: true
    state: enabled
  tags:
    - firewall
    - security
```

---

### 🔹 Running Tagged Tasks

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "webserver"
```

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --skip-tags "security"
```

---

### 🔹 Tagging Roles or Blocks

```yaml
roles:
  - { role: nginx, tags: ['web'] }

block:
  - name: Block with tags
    debug:
      msg: "This is tagged"
  tags: app
```

---

## 🔲 3. Blocks in Ansible

---

### 🔹 What Is a Block?

A **block** groups multiple tasks together, allowing you to:

* Apply common `when`, `tags`, `become`, `rescue`, etc. to all tasks inside
* Handle complex control flow

📘 [Blocks Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_blocks.html)

---

### 🔹 Syntax

```yaml
- name: Group tasks in a block
  block:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
  when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
  tags: web
```

---

### 🔹 Nested `block`, `rescue`, `always`

```yaml
- name: Main block
  block:
    - name: Try this
      command: /bin/false
  rescue:
    - name: Recover
      debug:
        msg: "Error handled"
  always:
    - name: Cleanup
      debug:
        msg: "Cleanup steps"
```

## ✅ Interview Questions & Scenarios

---

### ❓ Q1. What happens if a task fails in Ansible?

**Answer:**
By default, playbook execution stops. You can override this with `ignore_errors`, `rescue`, or using tags to skip sections.

---

### ❓ Q2. What is the difference between `ignore_errors` and `failed_when`?

| Directive       | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `ignore_errors` | Ignores any task failure                 |
| `failed_when`   | Custom logic to define what is a failure |

---

### ❓ Q3. Scenario: You want to continue playbook execution even if a task fails. How?

```yaml
- name: Run risky task
  command: /bin/false
  ignore_errors: yes
```

---

### ❓ Q4. Scenario: You only want to run firewall tasks without running the rest of the playbook.

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "firewall"
```

---

### ❓ Q5. Why and how are blocks used?

**Answer:**
Blocks allow grouping multiple tasks together to apply shared logic (`when`, `tags`, `rescue`, etc.) and are useful for error handling and clarity.

---

### ❓ Q6. What does `always:` block do?

**Answer:**
Tasks inside `always:` run regardless of success or failure of the preceding `block` or `rescue`.
