# ✅ 13. Ansible Vault – Full Guide

---

## 🔐 What is Ansible Vault?

**Ansible Vault** is a built-in feature that allows you to **encrypt sensitive data**, such as:

* Passwords
* API keys
* SSL certificates
* Private variables

This ensures that **sensitive information is not stored in plaintext** within your playbooks, variable files, or Git repositories.

## 🔐 Why Use Ansible Vault?

| Reason        | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Security    | Encrypt passwords, tokens, secrets    |
| ✅ Compliance  | Protect sensitive infrastructure data |
| ✅ Git-safe    | Store encrypted files in Git repos    |
| ✅ Easy to use | Integrated with playbooks and CLI     |

## 🔹 Basic Ansible Vault Commands

| Command                        | Description                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `ansible-vault create <file>`  | Create a new encrypted file        |
| `ansible-vault edit <file>`    | Open and edit the encrypted file   |
| `ansible-vault view <file>`    | View encrypted contents            |
| `ansible-vault encrypt <file>` | Encrypt an existing plaintext file |
| `ansible-vault decrypt <file>` | Decrypt an encrypted file          |
| `ansible-vault rekey <file>`   | Change the encryption password     |

---

## 🔹 Example: Creating an Encrypted Variable File

```bash
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

You’ll be prompted for a password and then dropped into a text editor to add content.

**Example content:**

```yaml
db_password: mysecretpass123
api_key: sk-abc123456
```

This file will now be encrypted.

---

## 🔹 Using Vault Variables in a Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: db
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Print DB password
      debug:
        var: db_password
```

To run this playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook secure-playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Or with a password file:

```bash
ansible-playbook secure-playbook.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
```

---

## 🔹 Encrypting/Decrypting Files Later

**Encrypt existing file:**

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt vars.yml
```

**Decrypt back to plaintext:**

```bash
ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml
```

---

## 🔹 Using a Vault ID (Best Practice for Multiple Vaults)

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id prod@prompt secrets-prod.yml
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id dev@prompt secrets-dev.yml
```

Use in playbook:

```yaml
vars_files:
  - secrets-prod.yml
```

Run:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-id prod@prompt
```

---

## 🔹 Using Vault in `requirements.yml`

If roles include encrypted variables:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

---

## 🔹 Best Practices with Vault

✅ **Do:**

* Use `--vault-id` for managing multiple vaults (prod/dev/staging)
* Store password file securely (not in Git)
* Encrypt only sensitive data, not full playbooks
* Use `ansible-vault view` instead of decrypting when possible

🚫 **Don’t:**

* Hardcode vault passwords
* Store `.vault_pass.txt` in source control
* Use same password across all environments

## ✅ Interview Questions & Scenario-Based Q\&A

---

### ❓ Q1: What is Ansible Vault?

**Answer:**
Ansible Vault is a feature that allows you to encrypt sensitive files such as credentials and tokens so they can be safely stored in source control.

---

### ❓ Q2: How do you use Vault with a playbook?

```yaml
vars_files:
  - secrets.yml
```

Run:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

---

### ❓ Q3: Scenario – You need to share an Ansible role with others, but it includes API keys. What do you do?

**Answer:**

* Encrypt the variable file with Ansible Vault
* Share only the encrypted file
* Provide the Vault password via prompt or secure channel

---

### ❓ Q4: How do you rekey a vault file?

```bash
ansible-vault rekey secrets.yml
```

You’ll be prompted for the old and new passwords.

---

### ❓ Q5: What is the benefit of using `--vault-id`?

**Answer:**
It allows using different passwords for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) and enables fine-grained access control.

---

### ❓ Q6: Can I encrypt only part of a file?

**Answer:**
No, Ansible Vault encrypts entire files. For partial encryption, consider separating sensitive parts into a separate file.
