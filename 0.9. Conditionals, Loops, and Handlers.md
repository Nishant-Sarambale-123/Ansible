# ✅ 9. Conditionals, Loops, and Handlers – Ansible Guide

---

## 🔷 1. Conditionals in Ansible

---

### 🔹 What are Conditionals?

**Conditionals** in Ansible allow you to execute tasks **only when certain conditions are true** using the `when` keyword.

📘 [Official Docs – Conditionals](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html)

---

### 🔹 Syntax

```yaml
- name: Install Apache on RedHat
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: present
  when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
```

---

### 🔹 Conditional with Variables

```yaml
- name: Install nginx if pkg is defined
  apt:
    name: "{{ pkg }}"
    state: present
  when: pkg is defined
```

---

### 🔹 Multiple Conditions

```yaml
when:
  - ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
  - ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "8"
```

OR operator:

```yaml
when: ansible_os_family == "Debian" or ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

---

## 🔷 2. Loops in Ansible

---

### 🔹 What are Loops?

Loops are used when you want to **repeat a task for multiple items** (like installing multiple packages, creating users, etc.).

📘 [Official Docs – Loops](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_loops.html)

---

### 🔹 Basic Loop (with `loop`)

```yaml
- name: Install multiple packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - nginx
    - curl
    - git
```

---

### 🔹 Loop with Dictionaries

```yaml
- name: Create users
  user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    shell: "{{ item.shell }}"
  loop:
    - { name: 'alice', shell: '/bin/bash' }
    - { name: 'bob', shell: '/bin/zsh' }
```

---

### 🔹 Loop with `with_items` (older syntax)

```yaml
- name: Add users
  user:
    name: "{{ item }}"
  with_items:
    - user1
    - user2
```

✅ Use `loop:` instead of `with_items:` in modern playbooks.

---

### 🔹 Nested Loops with `subelements`

```yaml
- name: Add multiple SSH keys to users
  authorized_key:
    user: "{{ item.0.name }}"
    key: "{{ item.1 }}"
  loop: "{{ users | subelements('keys') }}"
```

---

## 🔷 3. Handlers in Ansible

---

### 🔹 What are Handlers?

**Handlers** are special tasks triggered by a `notify` statement **only when the preceding task makes a change** (idempotent behavior).

📘 [Official Docs – Handlers](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_handlers.html)

---

### 🔹 Handler Example

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Update nginx config
    copy:
      src: nginx.conf
      dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    notify: restart nginx

handlers:
  - name: restart nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
```

✅ Handler runs **only if the copy task results in a change.**

---

### 🔹 Multiple Notifies to Same Handler

```yaml
notify:
  - restart nginx
  - reload firewall
```

---

### 🔹 Handler Best Practices

* Place handlers under a `handlers:` section at the same level as `tasks:`
* Use consistent names for handlers
* Use handlers for service restarts, reloads, etc.

---

## ✅ Interview Questions & Scenario-Based Q\&A

---

### ❓ Q1. What is the difference between `when` and `register`?

**Answer:**

* `when` is used to conditionally run a task
* `register` stores the result of a task

---

### ❓ Q2. Scenario: Only install a package if it's not already installed.

```yaml
- name: Check if nginx exists
  shell: which nginx
  register: nginx_exists
  ignore_errors: true

- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  when: nginx_exists.rc != 0
```

---

### ❓ Q3. How do you install multiple packages using a loop?

```yaml
- name: Install required packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - nginx
    - git
    - curl
```

---

### ❓ Q4. What is the use of handlers?

**Answer:**
Handlers are triggered only when notified by another task, and they run **after all tasks are completed**. Commonly used for service restarts or reloading configs.

---

### ❓ Q5. Scenario: You updated an nginx config. How to restart the service only if the config changed?

```yaml
- name: Update config
  template:
    src: nginx.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  notify: restart nginx

handlers:
  - name: restart nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
```

---

### ❓ Q6. Can you run a handler immediately?

**Answer:**
Yes, use `meta: flush_handlers`:

```yaml
- meta: flush_handlers
```

| Feature               | Use Case Example                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `when`                | Conditionally run tasks                          |
| `loop`                | Run task for multiple values                     |
| `register` + `when`   | Store task result and act based on it            |
| `notify` + `handlers` | Run service restarts or reloads only when needed |
