# ✅ Ansible Best Practices – Complete Guide

---

## 🔹 1. Project Directory Structure

Use a **clear, standardized directory structure** for readability, reusability, and scalability.

### ✅ Recommended Layout:

```
project/
├── inventories/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   └── hosts.yml
│   └── prod/
│       └── hosts.yml
├── roles/
│   ├── webserver/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── defaults/
│   │   └── vars/
├── group_vars/
│   └── all.yml
├── playbooks/
│   ├── site.yml
│   └── deploy.yml
├── requirements.yml
└── ansible.cfg
```

---

## 🔹 2. Use Roles to Organize Code

Split functionality into roles for **modularity** and **reuse**.

```bash
ansible-galaxy init nginx
```

Each role should:

* Handle one job (e.g., nginx setup, user management)
* Be independently testable
* Avoid interdependency

📘 [Roles Best Practices](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)

---

## 🔹 3. Use Inventories per Environment

Keep `dev`, `staging`, `prod` separated in:

```
inventories/
├── dev/
├── staging/
└── prod/
```

This avoids **accidental deployment to production** and allows **environment-specific configuration**.

---

## 🔹 4. Use Group/Host Variables

Use `group_vars/` and `host_vars/` for managing environment or host-specific settings.

```yaml
group_vars/webservers.yml
host_vars/web1.example.com.yml
```

---

## 🔹 5. Follow Idempotency

Design tasks to be **idempotent** — re-running a playbook shouldn't change anything if the system is already in the desired state.

Bad:

```yaml
- name: Restart service
  shell: systemctl restart nginx
```

Better:

```yaml
- name: Ensure nginx is running
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
```

---

## 🔹 6. Use Tags

Tags help **limit the scope** of playbook execution.

```yaml
- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  tags: web
```

Run:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "web"
```

---

## 🔹 7. Use Ansible Vault for Secrets

Do **not hardcode passwords** or API keys in playbooks. Use Ansible Vault:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
```

Use in playbook:

```yaml
vars_files:
  - secrets.yml
```

---

## 🔹 8. Use `check` and `diff` Modes

Run playbooks in dry-run mode to preview changes:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --check --diff
```

---

## 🔹 9. Lint and Test Playbooks

Use tools:

* ✅ `ansible-lint`: Checks for syntax & style
* ✅ `yamllint`: YAML file validator
* ✅ `molecule`: Role testing

```bash
ansible-lint playbook.yml
```

---

## 🔹 10. Version Control with Git

Track changes in Ansible code using Git:

* Store roles/playbooks in a repo
* Use branches for dev/test/prod
* Protect `main` branch

---

## 🔹 11. CI/CD Integration

* Run playbooks from GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab
* Automate playbook tests on commits
* Deploy only on approvals

---

## 🔹 12. Document Everything

Use:

* `README.md` per role/playbook
* Inline comments
* Task names that clearly explain actions

---

## 🔹 13. Avoid Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Anti-Pattern              | ✅ Best Practice                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Using `shell` unnecessarily | Use `apt`, `file`, `service`, etc. |
| Hardcoding values           | Use variables                      |
| Running as `root` always    | Use `become` carefully             |
| No error handling           | Use `block`, `rescue`, `always`    |
| Copy-paste playbooks        | Use roles or includes              |

## ✅ Interview Questions & Scenario-Based Q\&A

---

### ❓ Q1: Why is it recommended to use roles in Ansible?

**Answer:**
Roles provide modularity, reuse, maintainability, and make it easier to organize code into components.

---

### ❓ Q2: Scenario – You accidentally ran a playbook on production instead of dev. How would you prevent this in the future?

**Answer:**

* Use separate inventories (`inventories/dev`, `inventories/prod`)
* Add `--limit` safety on production
* Tag critical tasks and prompt for confirmation
* Use CI/CD approval gates

---

### ❓ Q3: How do you keep secrets secure in Ansible?

**Answer:**
By using **Ansible Vault** to encrypt variables and secrets.

---

### ❓ Q4: What is idempotency in Ansible?

**Answer:**
A task is idempotent if it does not make changes to the system when the desired state is already met.

---

### ❓ Q5: Why use `--check` mode?

**Answer:**
To perform a dry run, validating what changes **would** occur without actually applying them.

---

### ❓ Q6: Scenario – You want to install packages only on web servers. How do you target only them?

**Answer:**
Use `--limit` or `--tags`:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit webservers
```
