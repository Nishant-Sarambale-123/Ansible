# ✅ 7. Ansible Playbooks – Complete Guide

---

## 🔹 What is an Ansible Playbook?

An **Ansible Playbook** is a **YAML file** that defines a series of **tasks to be executed on managed hosts**. Unlike ad-hoc commands, playbooks are **declarative**, **reusable**, and **version-controllable**.

📘 [Official Docs – Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html)

---

## 🔹 Why Use Playbooks?

* ✅ Automate complex workflows
* ✅ Ensure repeatability and consistency
* ✅ Organize infrastructure as code
* ✅ Handle multiple hosts and tasks in one file
* ✅ Support conditionals, loops, variables, and roles

---

## 🔹 Playbook Structure

A playbook consists of:

```yaml
- name: <Name of the play>
  hosts: <target group>
  become: <true/false> # for privilege escalation
  vars:                # Optional variables
  tasks:               # List of tasks
    - name: <task name>
      module_name:
        key: value
```

---

### ✅ Example: Basic Nginx Playbook

```yaml
- name: Install and start Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

---

## 🔹 Key Playbook Components

---

### 1. `hosts`

Specifies the group or host to run the play against (from inventory).

```yaml
hosts: webservers
```

---

### 2. `become`

Used for privilege escalation (similar to sudo).

```yaml
become: true
```

📘 [Privilege Escalation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/become.html)

---

### 3. `tasks`

A list of actions to perform, each using a specific module.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install package
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
```

📘 [Tasks Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html#tasks-list)

---

### 4. `vars`

Define variables within the playbook.

```yaml
vars:
  pkg: nginx
```

Use it:

```yaml
- name: Install package
  apt:
    name: "{{ pkg }}"
    state: present
```

📘 [Using Variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html)

---

### 5. `handlers`

Triggered when notified (e.g., restart a service after file change).

```yaml
handlers:
  - name: restart nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
```

Use with:

```yaml
notify: restart nginx
```

📘 [Handlers](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_handlers.html)

---

### 6. `when`

Conditional execution of tasks.

```yaml
- name: Install on Ubuntu only
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
```

📘 [Conditionals](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html)

---

### 7. `with_items` (Loops)

```yaml
- name: Install multiple packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - nginx
    - curl
    - git
```

📘 [Loops](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_loops.html)

---

### 8. `tags`

Allow running selective tasks:

```yaml
- name: Restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
  tags: restart
```

Run with:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "restart"
```

📘 [Tags](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html)

---

## 🔹 Running a Playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> -i inventory.ini
```

Options:

* `--check`: Dry run (doesn’t change anything)
* `--diff`: Show what changes would be made
* `--tags`: Run specific tasks with tags

## ✅ Interview Questions & Scenario-Based Q\&A

---

### ❓ Q1: What is the difference between ad-hoc commands and playbooks?

**Answer:**

| Ad-Hoc Command        | Playbook                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| One-time use          | Reusable and version-controlled |
| Good for simple tasks | Good for complex workflows      |
| No structure needed   | Requires YAML structure         |
| Less auditable        | Fully auditable and documented  |

---

### ❓ Q2: What are handlers in playbooks?

**Answer:**
Handlers are special tasks triggered only when notified (e.g., after a config file changes) – commonly used for restarting services.

---

### ❓ Q3: Scenario – You want to install Apache only on RHEL servers, not Ubuntu. How?

**Answer:**

```yaml
- name: Install Apache on RHEL
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: present
  when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
```

---

### ❓ Q4: How do you reuse tasks in multiple playbooks?

**Answer:**

* Create **roles** or **import/include** tasks
* Use `include_tasks` or `import_playbook` for reuse

---

### ❓ Q5: What is the importance of `become: true`?

**Answer:**
Used for privilege escalation to run tasks as root (sudo), required for installing packages or changing system-level files.

---

### ❓ Q6: Can you pass variables to a playbook at runtime?

**Answer:**
Yes. Use `--extra-vars`:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --extra-vars "pkg=nginx"
```

📘 [Extra Vars](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#passing-variables-on-the-command-line)

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* ✅ Use `become: true` only when needed
* ✅ Use handlers for restart logic
* ✅ Avoid hardcoding values – use variables
* ✅ Use `tags` to organize and selectively run tasks
* ✅ Break large playbooks into roles or include files
* ✅ Always validate YAML syntax with `ansible-playbook --syntax-check`
