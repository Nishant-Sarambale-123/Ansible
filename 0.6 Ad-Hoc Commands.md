# ✅ 6. Ad-Hoc Commands in Ansible – Complete Guide

---

## 🔹 What are Ad-Hoc Commands?

**Ad-Hoc Commands** in Ansible are **one-liner commands** used to perform quick tasks **without writing a playbook**.

These are mostly used for:

* Simple configuration checks
* Troubleshooting
* Urgent updates
* Quick package installations or service restarts

## 🔹 Syntax of Ad-Hoc Commands

```bash
ansible <target-host-pattern> -m <module> -a "<module-arguments>" [options]
```

| Component          | Description                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `<target-host>`    | Group or host from inventory          |
| `-m <module>`      | Module name (e.g., `ping`, `command`) |
| `-a "<arguments>"` | Arguments to pass to the module       |
| `-i inventory`     | Optional path to custom inventory     |
| `-u`               | SSH user                              |
| `-b` or `--become` | Run with sudo/root privileges         |

## 🔹 Common Examples of Ad-Hoc Commands

---

### ✅ 1. **Ping All Hosts**

Test connectivity using the `ping` module:

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

## 🔹 Common Flags Used with Ad-Hoc Commands

| Flag                | Purpose                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `-i`                | Inventory file                        |
| `-u`                | SSH username                          |
| `--ask-pass`        | Ask for SSH password                  |
| `-b`                | Run with sudo (become root)           |

## 🔹 Advantages of Ad-Hoc Commands

* ✅ Quick and easy to use
* ✅ Great for troubleshooting or one-time fixes
* ✅ No need to write YAML/playbooks
* ✅ Ideal for exploratory tasks on inventory

---

## 🔹 Limitations of Ad-Hoc Commands

* ❌ Not reusable or version controlled
* ❌ Not ideal for complex workflows
* ❌ Difficult to audit or test
* ✅ Use Playbooks instead for repeatable tasks

## ✅ Interview Questions & Scenario-Based Q\&A

---

### ❓ Q1: What are ad-hoc commands in Ansible?

**Answer:**
Ad-hoc commands are single-line shell commands that allow users to run tasks instantly using Ansible without creating a playbook. They’re best for quick, one-off tasks.

---

### ❓ Q2: Can you use ad-hoc commands for privilege escalation?

**Answer:**
Yes. Use the `-b` (become) option to run tasks as root or another privileged user:

```bash
ansible all -b -m apt -a "name=curl state=present"
```

---

### ❓ Q3: Scenario – You need to install a package on 100 servers urgently. What will you do?

**Answer:**
Use an ad-hoc command:

```bash
ansible all -b -m yum -a "name=git state=present"
```

It’s faster than writing and running a playbook when the task is one-time.

---

### ❓ Q4: What module would you use to test SSH connectivity in ad-hoc?

**Answer:**
The `ping` module:

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

---

### ❓ Q5: How do you ensure a service is running using an ad-hoc command?

**Answer:**

```bash
ansible all -b -m service -a "name=nginx state=started"
```

---

### ❓ Q6: Difference between `shell` and `command` module in ad-hoc?

**Answer:**

| `command`                        | `shell`                          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Safer, no shell features allowed | Can use pipes, redirects, env    |
| No variable expansion            | Yes, supports variable expansion |
| Faster execution                 | Slightly heavier                 |

| Install a package | `ansible all -b -m apt -a "name=curl state=present"`         |
| Restart a service | `ansible web -b -m service -a "name=nginx state=restarted"`  |
| Copy a file       | `ansible web -m copy -a "src=index.html dest=/var/www/html"` |
| Gather facts      | `ansible all -m setup`                                       |
